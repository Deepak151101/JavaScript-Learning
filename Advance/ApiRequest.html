            // console.log(data);           // Gives full object data
            console.log(typeof data);       // object

    xhr.send();         // Initiates the request that you configured using xhr.open(). 
    // This Initiates the request and starts fetching data. It works asynchronously, meaning it does not block the rest of your JavaScript execution.
    // When data is received, onreadystatechange fires, and you can process the response
